# Script to include all the parameters used in all the scripts
# It should be called in the beginning of any main script.
# It should be used with the new versions of Function script and SPA and allows for fast multiple collection
# Vector 1 and Vector 2 can be obtained by running the new script hole pattern
# ComaIS and ComaStig matrices, used for coma and stig correction of multiple can be obtained within SerialEM through the ComavsIS calibration
